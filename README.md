# Backstab
This is the github repo for the [UQCS](https://github.com/UQComputingSociety) Hackathon 2022 project "Backstab". View the [ItchIO](https://q-horton.itch.io/backstab/) page.

"Backstab" is a prototype Unity game built in just 44 hours!

### *Dynamic Duo, or Arch-Nemeses?*
Together is always the best way to work, isn't it? Backstab is a game of co-operation and competition. Work together to conquer hoards of enemies and power up, but watch as this relationship grows sour. You may be friends now, but Backstab can help that.
