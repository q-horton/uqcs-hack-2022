# Backstab
This is the github repo for UQCS Hackathon 2022 project "Backstab".

Dynamic Duo, or Arch-Nemeses?!

Itch-io: q-horton.itch.io/backstab

"Backstab" is a prototype Unity game built in just 44 hours!

Together is always the best way to work, isn't it? Backstab is a game of co-operation and competition. 
Work together to conquer hoards of enemies, but watch as this relationship grows sour. You may be friends now, but Backslash can help that.
